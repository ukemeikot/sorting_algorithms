-- SORTING ALGORITHUMS AND BIG O NOTATION PROJECT--

What you are expected to learn from this project:

-> At least four different sorting algorithms

-> What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

-> How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

-> What is a stable sorting algorithm
